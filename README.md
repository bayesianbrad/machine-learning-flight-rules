# What are "flight rules"?

_Copied from: https://github.com/k88hudson/git-flight-rules_

> _Flight Rules_ are the hard-earned body of knowledge recorded in manuals that list, step-by-step, what to do if X occurs, and why. Essentially, they are extremely detailed, scenario-specific standard operating procedures. [...]

> NASA has been capturing our missteps, disasters and solutions since the early 1960s, when Mercury-era ground teams first started gathering "lessons learned" into a compendium that now lists thousands of problematic situations, from engine failure to busted hatch handles to computer glitches, and their solutions.

&mdash; Chris Hadfield, _An Astronaut's Guide to Life_.
